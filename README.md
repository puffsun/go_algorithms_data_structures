# Algorithms and Data Structures in Go

I created this repo while I'm learning [Go programming language](http://golang.org/)

### Prerequisite
This repo use [Ginkgo](http://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) and [Gomega](http://onsi.github.io/gomega/) to write and run tests, Ginkgo in a BDD style Go testing framework. After cloning this repo, you should run below code to install them:
* `go get github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo`
* `go get github.com/onsi/gomega`

Any issue, please send me a pull request, thanks.
