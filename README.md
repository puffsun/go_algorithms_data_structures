# Algorithms and Data Structures in Go

I created this repo while I'm learning [Go programming language](http://golang.org/).

### Prerequisite
This repo use [Ginkgo](http://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) and [Gomega](http://onsi.github.io/gomega/) to write and run tests, Ginkgo in a BDD style Go testing framework. After cloning this repo, you should run below code to install them:
* `go get github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo`
* `go get github.com/onsi/gomega`

To run all tests, go to the project root, run:
`ginkgo -r`

For more info on Ginkgo, please go to [the home page of Ginkgo](http://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/).

For more algorithms and data structures in Go, please visit [arnauddri/algorithms](https://github.com/arnauddri/algorithms).

Any issue, please send me a pull request, thanks.
